So far things are going smooth. But we have requirement to add text or table contents to the docx file that is opened programmatically. We tried annotations, and ContentEdit. But they seem to be used for PDF documents. And I could not find any resources for this problem. Is there any APIs for this? [...] Thank you for contacting us about this. Unfortunately, the SDK does not have the ability to edit docx files directly. However, it is possible to add table content to docx files using the UI as shown on the screenshot below:  \\n\\nScreenshot 2025-01-17 at 13.03.14\\n\\nScreenshot 2025-01-17 at 13.03.141212√ó472 12.8 KB\\n\\nScreenshot 2025-01-17 at 13.03.14\\n\\nIs this an option for you?
