[...] |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Criteria | CIBIL Score | Credit Score |\\n| Definition | A credit score is given by the Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) to assess a person’s creditworthiness. | A numerical representation of a borrower’s creditworthiness is determined using several criteria, including duration of credit history, payment history, credit history, and credit utilization. | [...] When assessing creditworthiness, two terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same: the CIBIL score and the credit score. Actually, the former is a type of the latter.
